Galactogogues should never replace evaluation and counseling on modifiable factors that affect milk production.[3,4] No data exist on the excretion of any components of basil into breastmilk or on the safety and efficacy of basil in nursing mothers or infants. Basil is \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) as a food by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Basil appears to be safe during breastfeeding in the amounts found in foods, but many sources recommend that medicinal doses of basil not be used during lactation because of its estragole content and lack of safety information.[5]",

Psychiatric symptoms have occurred rarely. Some experts recommend cabergoline as a safer alternative to bromocriptine for lactation suppression, but others do not.[3-6] The disadvantage of cabergoline is that it has a half-life of about 68 hours, which means that any adverse effects might persist for a prolonged period of time.

A maternal intake limit of 300 to 500 mg daily might be a safe level of intake for most mothers.[2,3] However, preterm and younger newborn infants metabolize caffeine very slowly and may have serum levels of caffeine and other active caffeine metabolites similar to their mothers' levels,[2,4,5] so a lower intake level preferable in the mothers of these infants. Other sources of caffeine, such as cola and energy drinks, yerba mate or guarana, will have similar dose-related effects on the breastfed infant.

A few cases of minor behavioral side effects such as drowsiness or fussiness have been reported, but no adverse effects on development have been found in infants followed for up to a year. Infants exposed in utero can have withdrawal effects postpartum despite breastfeeding and continued maternal citalopram use.[1,2] If citalopram is required by the mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding. Some experts do not recommend citalopram during nursing,[3] but a safety scoring system finds citalopram to be acceptable during breastfeeding.[4] If the mother was taking citalopram during pregnancy or if other antidepressants have been ineffective, most experts recommend against changing medications during breastfeeding. Otherwise, agents with lower excretion into breastmilk may be preferred, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. The breastfed infant should be monitored for behavioral side effects such as sedation or fussiness. Mothers taking an SSRI during pregnancy and postpartum may have more difficulty breastfeeding, although this might be a reflection of their disease state.[5] These mothers may need additional breastfeeding support. Breastfed infants exposed to an SSRI during the third trimester of pregnancy have a lower risk of poor neonatal adaptation than formula-fed infants.",

In general, maternal use of oral narcotics during breastfeeding can cause infant drowsiness, central nervous system depression and even death. Hydromorphone use should be limited in nursing mothers.[1] Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of narcotic analgesics. Once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of hydromorphone to a few days at a low dosage with close infant monitoring. If the baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness, a physician should be contacted immediately.",

Other evidence indicates that breastfeeding after cessation of long-term pamidronate treatment appears to have no adverse effects on the infant. Some experts recommend monitoring the infant's serum calcium during the first 2 months postpartum if the mother received pamidronate during pregnancy or nursing.[2]",

One infant was breastfed, apparently without noticeable harm, following maternal intravitreal ranibizumab injections. VEGF levels in breastmilk were not changed following the injection. In another woman who did not breastfeed had decreasing VEGF levels in milk over a 28-day period. The role that breastfeeding has in maintaining VEGF levels in not clear. Ranibizumab has the shortest half-life of the VEGF inhibitors used in the eye, and thus might be the preferred agent.[1] Note that the typical alternative to breastmilk is infant formula, which contains no VEGF.",

Spanish sage (Salvia lavandulaefolia) is a related species with similar components, although its thujone content is lower. Sage is often misidentified and adulterated; Salvia bertolonii or Salvia pratensis are sometimes used in instead of Salvia officinalis or as an adulterant. Sage purportedly reduces lactation and has been used to aid with weaning or an overabundant milk supply;[1-4] although it is also reportedly used in Turkey to increase milk supply.[5] No scientific studies could be located that evaluate the effect of sage on the milk supply. No data exist on the safety of sage in nursing mothers or infants. In general, sage is well tolerated, with occasional nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, agitation, and wheezing.

    "Title": "Zanamivir",
    "Text1": "No information is available on the use of zanamivir during breastfeeding. One group of authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed 5 kg infant would receive about 0.075 mg daily in breastmilk after an inhaled maternal dose of 10 mg, which is less than 1% of the dose in older children. In addition, because zanamivir is poorly absorbed orally, it is not likely to reach the bloodstream of the infant in clinically important amounts.[1]",

    "Text1": "This record refers to the use of ziv-aflibercept for treating cancer. No information is available on the use of ziv-aflibercept during breastfeeding. Because ziv-aflibercept is a large protein molecule with a molecular weight of 115,000, the amount in milk is likely to be very low and absorption is unlikely because it is probably destroyed in the infant's gastrointestinal tract. However, ziv-aflibercept is usually used in combination with other potentially toxic chemotherapy agents and most sources consider breastfeeding to be contraindicated during maternal antineoplastic drug therapy. Intravitreal aflibercept decreased vascular endothelial growth factor in breastmilk in one woman.[1] Since VEGF is present in human milk and is thought to help in maturation of the infant’s gastrointestinal tract, concern has been raised about the maternal use of VEGF inhibitors during breastfeeding. Note that the typical alternative to breastmilk is infant formula, which contains no VEGF.",

Although no adverse reactions have been reported in breastfed infants, the number of infants reported have been small. Alternative drugs are preferred, but if it must be given, monitor the infant for drowsiness, adequate weight gain, and developmental milestones, especially in younger or exclusively breastfed infants and when using combinations of anticonvulsant drugs. Some clinicians recommend that mothers taking zonisamide only partially breastfeed in order to reduce the exposure of the infant to the drug and to consider monitoring infants’ serum zonisamide concentrations.[1]",
