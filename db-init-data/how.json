When the inhalation aerosol or powder for oral inhalation is used to treat or prevent symptoms of lung disease, it is usually used every 4 to 6 hours as needed. When the inhalation aerosol or powder for oral inhalation is used to prevent breathing difficulty during exercise, it is usually used 15 to 30 minutes before exercise. The nebulizer solution is usually used three or four times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use albuterol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nCall your doctor if your symptoms worsen or if you feel that albuterol inhalation no longer controls your symptoms. If you were told to use albuterol as needed to treat your symptoms and you find that you need to use the medication more often than usual, call your doctor.\n\nAlbuterol controls symptoms of asthma and other lung diseases but does not cure them. Do not stop using albuterol without talking to your doctor.\n\nEach albuterol aerosol inhaler is designed to provide 60 or 200 inhalations, depending on its size. Each albuterol powder inhaler is designed to provide 200 inhalations. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. Dispose of the aerosol inhaler after you have used the labeled number of inhalations, even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed. Dispose of the powder inhaler 13 months after you open the foil wrapper, after the expiration date on the package, or after you have used the labeled number of inhalation, whichever comes first.\n\nYour inhaler may come with an attached counter that keeps track of the number of inhalations you have used. The counter also tells you when to call your doctor or pharmacist to refill your prescription and when there are no inhalations left in the inhaler. Read the manufacturer's instructions to learn how to use the counter. If you have this type of inhaler, you should not try to change the numbers or remove the counter from the inhaler.\n\nIf your inhaler does not come with an attached counter, you will need to keep track of the number of inhalations you have used. You can divide the number of inhalations in your inhaler by the number of inhalations you use each day to find out how many days your inhaler will last. Do not float the canister in water to see if it still contains medication.\n\nThe inhaler that comes with albuterol aerosol is designed for use only with a canister of albuterol. Never use it to inhale any other medication, and do not use any other inhaler to inhale albuterol.\n\nBe careful not to get albuterol inhalation into your eyes.\n\nDo not use your albuterol inhaler when you are near a flame or source of heat. The inhaler may explode if it is exposed to very high temperatures.\n\nBefore you use albuterol inhaler or jet nebulizer for the first time, read the written instructions that come with the inhaler or nebulizer. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it. Practice using the inhaler or nebulizer while he or she watches.\n\nIf your child will be using the inhaler, be sure that he or she knows how to use it. Watch your child each time he or she uses the inhaler to be sure that he or she is using it correctly.\n\nTo inhale the aerosol using an inhaler, follow these steps:\nRemove the protective dust cap from the end of the mouthpiece. If the dust cap was not placed on the mouthpiece, check the mouthpiece for dirt or other objects. Be sure that the canister is fully and firmly inserted in the mouthpiece.\nIf you are using the inhaler for the first time or if you have not used the inhaler in more than 14 days, you will need to prime it. You may also need to prime the inhaler if it has been dropped. Ask your pharmacist or check the manufacturer's information if this happens. To prime the inhaler, shake it well and then press down on the canister 4 times to release 4 sprays into the air, away from your face. Be careful not to get albuterol in your eyes.\nShake the inhaler well.\nBreathe out as completely as possible through your mouth.\nHold the canister with the mouthpiece on the bottom, facing you and the canister pointing upward. Place the open end of the mouthpiece into your mouth. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece.\nBreathe in slowly and deeply through the mouthpiece.At the same time, press down once on the container to spray the medication into your mouth.\nTry to hold your breath for 10 seconds. remove the inhaler, and breathe out slowly.\nIf you were told to use 2 puffs, wait 1 minute and then repeat steps 3-7.\nReplace the protective cap on the inhaler.\nClean your inhaler regularly. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your inhaler.\nTo inhale the powder using the inhaler, follow these steps. Do not use the Respiclick inhaler with a spacer:\nIf you will be using a new inhaler for the first time, remove it from the foil wrapper. Look at the dose counter at the back of the inhaler and check that you see the number 200 in the window.\nHolding the inhaler upright, with the cap on the bottom and the inhaler pointing upwards, load the dose by opening the protective dust cap at the end of the mouthpiece until it clicks. Do not open the cap unless you are ready to use the inhaler. Every time the protective cap is opened, a dose is ready to inhale. You will see the number in the dose counter go down. Do not waste doses by opening the inhaler unless you are inhaling a dose.\nBreathe out as completely as possible through your mouth. Do not blow or exhale into the inhaler.\nPlace the mouthpiece between your lips well into your mouth. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece. Inhale slowly and deeply through your mouth. Do not breath in through your nose. Make sure that your fingers or lips do not block the vent above the mouthpiece.\nRemove the inhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for 10 seconds or as long as you comfortably can. Do not blow or exhale through the inhaler.\nClose the cap firmly over the mouthpiece.\nIf you are to inhale 2 puffs, repeat steps 2-6.\nKeep the inhaler clean and dry at all times. To clean your inhaler, use a clean, dry tissue or cloth. Do not wash or put any part of your inhaler in water.\nTo inhale the solution using a nebulizer, follow these steps;\nRemove one vial of albuterol solution from the foil pouch. Leave the rest of the vials in the pouch until you are ready to use them.\nLook at the liquid in the vial. It should be clear and colorless.

Check to be sure that the bottle contains liquid medication. Call your pharmacist and do not use the medication if the bottle contains powder or if there is no dosing dispenser in the box.Shake the bottle up and down for at least 10 seconds to mix the medication evenly.Remove the bottle cap. Check that the bottle adapter has been inserted into top of the bottle.If the bottle adapter has not been inserted into the top of the bottle, insert it by placing the bottom of the adapter into the opening of the bottle and pressing down firmly on it with your thumb. Call your pharmacist if the box does not contain a bottle adapter. Do not remove the bottle adapter from the bottle once it is inserted.Insert the tip of the dosing dispenser into the bottle adapter and push the plunger all the way down.Turn the bottle upside down.Pull the plunger back to withdraw the amount of oral suspension prescribed by your doctor. If you are not sure how to correctly measure the dose your doctor has prescribed, ask your doctor or pharmacist.Remove the dosing dispenser and slowly squirt the oral suspension directly into your mouth or your child's mouth.Replace the cap on the bottle and close tightly.Clean the dosing dispenser after each use by placing it in the dishwasher or by rinsing with tap water.Your doctor may start you on a low dose of methylphenidate and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every week.Your condition should improve during your treatment. Call your doctor if your symptoms worsen at any time during your treatment or do not improve after 1 month.Your doctor may tell you to stop taking methylphenidate from time to time to see if the medication is still needed.

Use flunisolide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.Talk to your doctor about how you should use your other oral and inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with flunisolide inhalation. If you are using any other inhaled medications, ask your doctor if you should inhale these medications a certain amount of time before and after you inhale flunisolide inhalation. If you were taking an oral steroid such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Rayos), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose starting at least one week after you begin to use flunisolide inhalation.Flunisolide inhalation helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Do not use flunisolide inhalation during an asthma attack. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks.Your doctor will probably start you on an average dose of flunisolide inhalation. Your doctor may increase it if your symptoms have not improved after at least 4 weeks and later may decrease your dose when your symptoms are controlled.Flunisolide inhalation controls asthma but does not cure it. It may take 2 to 4 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of the medication. Continue to use flunisolide inhalation even if you feel well.

After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. You should also keep track of the number of inhalations you use each day to know the exact amount of sprays that remain in your inhaler. Throw away the canister after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed. If your inhaler is dropped, do not use the number on the counter to predict the number of sprays left in your inhaler.Before you use your flunisolide aerosol inhaler the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it.Do not use your flunisolide inhaler while you are near an open flame or a heat source. The inhaler may explode if it is exposed to very high temperatures.To use the aerosol inhaler, follow these steps. Do not use the inhaler with any additional spacers.:\n\nBe sure that the inhaler is at room temperature.If you are using the inhaler for the first time or if you have not used the inhaler in more than 14 days, prime it by releasing 2 test sprays into the air, away from your face. Be careful not to spray the medication into your eyes or face.Place the bottom of the gray spacer on the base of your thumb and your index finger on the canister. Check to make sure that the canister is placed into the purple actuator.Hold the canister between your thumb and index finger and shake the inhaler.Breathe in and out through your mouth.After breathing out, place the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around it.Breathe in deeply and slowly through your mouth. At the same time, press down firmly on the center of the dose indicator at the top of the canister with your index finger. Remove your index finger as soon as the spray is released.When you have breathed in fully for at least 3 seconds, remove the inhaler from your mouth and close your mouth.Try to hold your breath for about 10 seconds, then breathe out gently and then breathe normally.If your doctor has told you to take more than one puffs per treatment, repeat steps 4 through 9.Press the actuator back into the straight position.Rinse your mouth with water and spit the water out.

        "Text1": "How should this medicine be used?\n\nThe combination of albuterol and ipratropium comes as a solution (liquid) to inhale by mouth using a nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled) and as a spray to inhale by mouth using an inhaler. It is usually inhaled four times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use albuterol and ipratropium exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor may tell you to use additional doses of albuterol and ipratropium inhalation if you experience symptoms such as wheezing, difficulty breathing, or chest tightness. Follow these directions carefully, and do not use extra doses of medication unless your doctor tells you that you should. Do not use more than 2 extra doses of the nebulizer solution per day. Do not use the inhalation spray more than six times in 24 hours.\n\nCall your doctor if your symptoms worsen, if you feel that albuterol and ipratropium inhalation no longer controls your symptoms, or if you find that you need to use extra doses of the medication more often.\n\nIf you are using the inhaler, your medication will come in cartridges. Each cartridge of albuterol and ipratropium inhalation spray is designed to provide 120 inhalations. This is enough medication to last one month if you use one inhalation four times a day. After you use all 120 doses, the inhaler will lock and will not release any more medication, There is a dose indicator on the side of the inhaler that keeps track of how much medication is left in the cartridge. Check the dose indicator from time to time to see how much medication is left. When the pointer on the dose indicator enters the red area, the cartridge contains enough medication for 7 days and it is time to refill your prescription so that you will not run out of medication.\n\nBe careful not to get albuterol and ipratropium inhalation into your eyes. If you get albuterol and ipratropium in your eyes, you may develop narrow angle glaucoma (a serious eye condition that may cause loss of vision). If you already have narrow angle glaucoma, your condition may worsen. You may experience widened pupils (black circles in the center of the eyes), eye pain or redness, blurred vision, and vision changes such as seeing halos around lights, or seeing unusual colors Call your doctor if you get albuterol and ipratropium into your eyes or if you develop these symptoms.\n\nThe inhaler that comes with albuterol and ipratropium spray is designed for use only with a cartridge of albuterol and ipratropium. Never use it to inhale any other medication, and do not use any other inhaler to inhale the medication in a cartridge of albuterol and ipratropium.\n\nBefore you use albuterol and ipratropium inhalation for the first time, read the written instructions that come with the inhaler or nebulizer. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it. Practice using the inhaler or nebulizer while he or she watches.\n\nTo prepare the inhaler for use, follow these steps:\nPut the inhaler together before you use it for the first time. To start, take the inhaler out of the box, and keep the orange cap closed. Press the safety catch and pull off the clear base of the inhaler. Be careful not to touch the piercing element inside of the base\nThe inhaler must be discarded three months after you put it together. Write this date on the label of the inhaler so you will not forget when you need to discard your inhaler.\nTake the cartridge out of the box and insert the narrow end into the inhaler. You can press the inhaler against a hard surface to be sure it is inserted correctly. Replace the clear plastic base on the inhaler.\nHold the inhaler upright with the orange cap closed. Turn the clear base in the direction of the white arrows until it clicks.\nFlip the orange cap so that it is fully open. Point the inhaler toward the ground.\nPress the dose release button. Close the orange cap.\nRepeat steps 4-6 until you see a spray coming out of the inhaler. Then repeat these steps three more times.\nThe inhaler is now primed and ready for use. You will not need to prime your inhaler again unless you do not use it for longer than 3 days. If you do not use your inhaler for more than 3 days, you will need to release one spray toward the ground before you start to use it again. If you do not use your inhaler for more than 21 days, you will need to follow steps 4-7 to prime the inhaler again.\nTo inhale the spray using the inhaler, follow these steps:\nHold the inhaler upright with the orange cap closed. Turn the clear base in the direction of the white arrows until it clicks.\nOpen the orange cap.\nBreathe out slowly and completely.\nPlace the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around it. Be careful not to cover the air vents with your lips.\nPoint the inhaler toward the back of your throat and breathe in slowly and deeply.\nWhile you are breathing in, press the dose release button. Continue to breathe in as the spray is released into your mouth.\nHold your breath for 10 seconds or as long as you comfortably can.\nTake the inhaler out of your mouth and close the orange cap. Keep the cap closed until you are ready to use the inhaler again.\nTo inhale the solution using a nebulizer, follow these steps:\nRemove one vial of medication from the foil pouch. Put the rest of the vials back into the pouch until you are ready to use them.\nTwist off the top of the vial and squeeze all of the liquid into the reservoir of the nebulizer.\nConnect the nebulizer reservoir to the mouthpiece or face mask.\nConnect the nebulizer reservoir to the compressor.\nPut the mouthpiece in your mouth or put on the face mask. Sit in a comfortable, upright position and turn on the compressor.\nBreathe in calmly, deeply, and evenly through your mouth for about 5 to 15 minutes until mist stops forming in the nebulizer chamber.\n\nClean your inhaler or nebulizer regularly. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your inhaler or nebulizer.",

Transdermal estradiol is usually applied once or twice a week, depending on the brand of patch that is used. Some women wear a patch all the time, and other women wear a patch according to a rotating schedule that alternates 3 weeks when the patch is worn followed by 1 week when the patch is not worn. Always apply your transdermal patch on the same day(s) of the week every week. There may be a calendar on the inner flap of your medication carton where you can keep track of your patch change schedule. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use transdermal estradiol exactly as directed. Do not apply more or fewer patches or apply the patches more often than prescribed by your doctor.Your doctor will start you on a low dose of transdermal estradiol and may increase your dose if your symptoms are still bothersome. If you are already taking or using an estrogen medication, your doctor will tell you how to switch from the estrogen medication you are taking or using to transdermal estradiol. Be sure you understand these instructions. Talk to your doctor about how well transdermal estradiol works for you.You should apply estradiol patches to clean, dry, cool skin in the lower stomach area, below your waistline. Some brands of patches may also be applied to the upper buttocks or the hips. Ask your doctor or pharmacist or read the manufacturer's information that comes with your patches to find the best place(s) to apply the brand of patches you have received. Do not apply any brand of estradiol patches to the breasts or to skin that is oily, damaged, cut, or irritated. Do not apply estradiol patches to the waistline where they may be rubbed off by tight clothing or to the lower buttocks where they may be rubbed off by sitting. Be sure that the skin in the area where you plan to apply an estradiol patch is free of lotion, powders, or creams. After you apply a patch to a particular area, wait at least 1 week before applying another patch to that spot. Some brands of patches should not be applied to an area of the skin that is exposed to sunlight. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist to find out whether your patch should be applied to an area that will not be exposed to sunlight.Talk to your doctor or pharmacist or read the manufacturer's information that came with your medication to find out if you need to be careful when you swim, bathe, shower, or use a sauna while wearing an estradiol transdermal patch. Some brands of patches are not likely to be affected by these activities, but some brands of patches may loosen. Some types of patches may also be pulled and loosened by your clothes or towel when you change clothes or dry your body. You may need to check that your patch is still firmly attached after these activities.If the patch loosens or falls off before it is time to replace it, try to press it back in place with your fingers. Be careful not to touch the sticky side of the patch with your fingers while you are doing this. If the patch cannot be pressed back on, fold it in half so it sticks to itself, dispose of it safely, so that it is out of the reach of children and pets, and apply a fresh patch to a different area. Replace the fresh patch on your next scheduled patch change day.Each brand of estradiol transdermal patches should be applied following the specific directions given in the manufacturer's information for the patient. Read this information carefully before you start using estradiol transdermal and each time you refill your prescription. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. The following general directions can help you remember some important things to do when you apply any type of estradiol transdermal patch.\n\nTear open the pouch with your fingers. Do not use scissors because they may damage the patch. Do not open the pouch until you are ready to apply the patch.Remove the patch from the pouch. There may be a silver foil sticker used to protect the patch from moisture inside the pouch. Do not remove this sticker from the pouch.Remove the protective liner from the patch and press the sticky side of the patch against your skin in the area you have chosen to wear your patch. Some patches have a liner that is made to peel off in two pieces. If your patch has that type of liner, you should peel off one part of the liner and press that side of the patch against your skin. Then fold back the patch, peel off the other part of the liner and press the second side of the patch against your skin. Always be careful not to touch the sticky side of the patch with your fingers.Press down on the patch with your fingers or palm for 10 seconds. Be sure that the patch is firmly attached to your skin, especially around its edges.Wear the patch all the time until it is time to remove it. When it is time to remove the patch, slowly peel it off of your skin. Fold the patch in half so that the sticky sides are pressed together and dispose of it safely, so that is out of reach of children and pets.Some brands of patches may leave a sticky substance on your skin. In some cases, this can be rubbed off easily. In other cases, you should wait 15 minutes and then remove the substance using an oil or lotion. Read the information that came with your patches to find out what to do if a substance is left on your skin after you remove your patch.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.",

Never use it to inhale any other medication, and never use any other inhaler to inhale ciclesonide.\n\nEach canister of ciclesonide aerosol is designed to provide 60 inhalations. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. Your inhaler comes with an attached counter that will change as every 10 sprays are used. When the number that shows on the counter is 020, you should call your doctor or pharmacist to refill your prescription. When the number that shows on the counter is 000, you should not use that canister anymore. You should also keep track of the number of inhalations you use each day to know the exact amount of sprays that remain in your inhaler. Throw away the canister after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed. If your inhaler is dropped, do not use the number on the counter to predict the number of sprays left in your inhaler.\n\nBefore you use your ciclesonide aerosol inhaler the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it.\n\nDo not use your ciclesonide inhaler while you are near an open flame or a heat source. The inhaler may explode if it is exposed to very high temperatures.\n\nTo use the aerosol, follow these steps:\nBe sure that the inhaler is at room temperature.\nRemove the cap from the mouthpiece.\nBe sure the canister is fully and firmly inserted in the actuator. You do not need to shake your inhaler before each use.\nIf you are using the inhaler for the first time or if you have not used the inhaler in more than 10 days, prime it by releasing 3 test sprays into the air, away from your face. Be careful not to spray the medication into your eyes or face.\nBreathe out through your mouth.\nHold the inhaler facing you with the mouthpiece on the bottom. Place your thumb under the mouthpiece and your index finger on the center of the dose indicator at the top of the canister. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around it, keeping your tongue below it.\nBreathe in deeply and slowly through your mouth. At the same time, press down firmly on the center of the dose indicator at the top of the canister with your index finger. Remove your index finger as soon as the spray is released.\nWhen you have breathed in fully, remove the inhaler from your mouth and close your mouth.\nTry to hold your breath for about 10 seconds, then breathe out gently.\nPut the cap back on the mouthpiece.\nRinse your mouth with water and spit the water out. Do not swallow the water.\n\nClean your inhaler once a week. To clean your inhaler, use a clean, dry tissue or cloth. Do not wash or put any part of your inhaler in water.",

This depends on whether you were using another type of birth control in the past month, were not using birth control, or have recently given birth or had an abortion or miscarriage. In some cases, you may need to use an additional method of birth control for the first 7 days that you use the contraceptive ring. Your doctor will tell you whether you need to use backup birth control and will help you choose a method, such as male condoms and/or spermicides. You should not use a diaphragm, cervical cap, or a female condom when a contraceptive ring is in place.If you are using the NuvaRing® vaginal ring, insert a new ring after the 1-week break; repeat the cycle of 3 weeks of use with a 1-week break, using a new vaginal ring for each cycle.If you are using the Annovera® vaginal ring, re-insert the clean vaginal ring after the 1-week break; repeat the cycle of 3 weeks of use with a 1-week break for up to 13 cycles.The contraceptive ring will usually stay in your vagina until you remove it.

Call your doctor if your contraceptive ring slips out often.If your NuvaRing® contraceptive ring slips out, you should rinse it with cool or lukewarm (not hot) water and try to replace it within 3 hours. However, if your NuvaRing® contraceptive ring slips out and it is broken, discard it and replace it with a new vaginal ring. If your ring falls out and gets lost, you should replace it with a new ring and remove the new ring at the same time you were scheduled to remove the ring that was lost. If you do not replace your NuvaRing® vaginal ring within the appropriate time, you must use a non-hormonal backup method of birth control (e.g., condoms with spermicide) until you have had the ring in place for 7 days in a row.If your Annovera® contraceptive vaginal ring falls out, wash it with mild soap and warm water, rinse and pat dry with a clean cloth towel or paper towel, and try to replace it within 2 hours. If your vaginal ring is out of place for more than a total of 2 hours over the cycle of 3 weeks that the vaginal ring is to be inserted (e.g., from falling out one time or several times), you must use a non-hormonal backup method of birth control (e.g., condoms with spermicide) until you have had the ring in place for 7 days in a row.Regularly check for the presence of the vaginal ring in the vagina before and after intercourse.Contraceptive vaginal rings will work only as long as they are used regularly.

High blood sugar may also occur if the tubing leaks or becomes blocked, disconnected, or kinks. You may need to change the infusion set and insulin in the pump or infusion site if you have high blood sugar, the pump alarm sounds, or the insulin flow is blocked. If the problem cannot be found quickly and corrected, call your doctor right away. You may need to temporarily use insulin by subcutaneous injection (using syringes or an insulin pen).

The last set of tablets are a different color. These tablets may contain an inactive ingredient, or they may contain a very low dose of estrogen. Start your new packet the day after you take your 91st tablet.Your doctor will tell you when you should start taking your oral contraceptive. Oral contraceptives are usually started on the first or fifth day of your menstrual period or on the first Sunday after or on which bleeding begins. Your doctor will also tell you whether you need to use another method of birth control during the first 7 to 9 days that you take your oral contraceptive and will help you choose a method. Follow these directions carefully.You will probably experience withdrawal bleeding similar to a menstrual period while you are taking the inactive tablets or the low dose estrogen tablets or during the week that you do not take your oral contraceptive. If you are taking the type of packet that only contains active tablets, you will not experience any scheduled bleeding, but you may experience unexpected bleeding and spotting, especially at the beginning of your treatment. Be sure to start taking your new packet on schedule even if you are still bleeding.You may need to use a backup method of birth control if you vomit or have diarrhea while you are taking an oral contraceptive. Talk to your doctor about this before you begin to take your oral contraceptive so that you can prepare a backup method of birth control in case it is needed. If you vomit or have diarrhea while you are taking an oral contraceptive, call your doctor to find out how long you should use the backup method.If you have recently given birth, wait until 4 weeks after delivery to begin taking oral contraceptives. If you have had an abortion or miscarriage, talk to your doctor about when you should begin taking oral contraceptives.Oral contraceptives will work only as long as they are taken regularly. Continue to take oral contraceptives every day even if you are spotting or bleeding, have an upset stomach, or do not think that you are likely to become pregnant. Do not stop taking oral contraceptives without talking to your doctor.",

Fluticasone aerosol oral inhalation (Flovent HFA) is usually inhaled twice daily. Fluticasone powder for oral inhalation is usually inhaled once daily (Armonair, Arnuity Ellipta) or twice daily (Armonair Respiclick, Flovent Diskus). Try to use fluticasone at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use fluticasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.Talk to your doctor about how you should use your other oral and inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with fluticasone inhalation. If you are using any other inhaled medications, ask your doctor if you should inhale these medications a certain amount of time before and after you inhale fluticasone inhalation. If you were taking an oral steroid such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Rayos), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose starting at least 1 week after you begin to use fluticasone.Fluticasone helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Do not use fluticasone during an asthma attack. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks.Your doctor will probably start you on an average dose of fluticasone. Your doctor may decrease your dose when your symptoms are controlled or increase it if your symptoms have not improved after at least 2 weeks.Fluticasone controls asthma but does not cure it. Your symptoms may improve 24 hours after you begin using fluticasone, but it may take 2 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of the medication. Continue to use fluticasone even if you feel well. Do not stop using fluticasone without talking to your doctor.If your child will be using the inhaler, be sure that they know how to use it. Watch your child each time they use the inhaler to be sure that they are using it correctly.Tell your doctor if your asthma worsens during your treatment. Call your doctor if you have an asthma attack that does not stop when you use your fast-acting asthma medication, or if you need to use more of your fast-acting medication than usual.The inhaler that comes with fluticasone aerosol is designed for use only with a canister of fluticasone. Never use it to inhale any other medication, and never use any other inhaler to inhale fluticasone.Each product is designed to provide 30, 60, or120 inhalations, depending on the type of inhaler. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. You should keep track of the number of inhalations you have used. You can divide the number of inhalations in your inhaler by the number of inhalations you use each day to find out how many days your inhaler will last. Dispose of the canister after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed. Do not float the canister in water to see if it still contains medication.Do not use your fluticasone aerosol inhaler while you are near an open flame or a heat source. The inhaler may explode if it is exposed to very high temperatures.Before you use fluticasone the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it. Practice using the inhaler while they watch you.",

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use ipratropium exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.Talk to your doctor about what you should do if you experience symptoms such as wheezing, difficulty breathing, or chest tightness. Your doctor will probably give you a different inhaler that acts more quickly than ipratropium to relieve these symptoms. Your doctor may also tell you to use additional puffs of ipratropium along with other medications to treat these symptoms. Follow these directions carefully and be sure you know when you should use each of your inhalers. Do not use extra puffs of ipratropium unless your doctor tells you that you should. Never use more than 12 puffs of ipratropium inhalation aerosol in a 24-hour period.Call your doctor if your symptoms worsen or if you feel that ipratropium inhalation no longer controls your symptoms. Also call your doctor if you were told to use extra doses of ipratropium and you find that you need to use more doses than usual.If you are using the inhaler, your medication will come in canisters. Each canister of ipratropium aerosol is designed to provide 200 inhalations. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. You should keep track of the number of inhalations you have used. You can divide the number of inhalations in your inhaler by the number of inhalations you use each day to find out how many days your inhaler will last. Dispose of the canister after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed. Do not float the canister in water to see if it still contains medication.Be careful not to get ipratropium into your eyes. If you are using the inhaler, keep your eyes closed when you use the medication. If you are using the nebulizer solution, you should use a nebulizer with a mouthpiece instead of a face mask. If you must use a face mask, ask your doctor how you can prevent the medication from leaking. If you get ipratropium in your eyes, you may develop narrow angle glaucoma (a serious eye condition that may cause loss of vision). If you already have narrow angle glaucoma, your condition may worsen. You may experience widened pupils (black circles in the center of the eyes), eye pain or redness, blurred vision, and vision changes such as seeing halos around lights. Call your doctor if you get ipratropium into your eyes or if you develop these symptoms.The inhaler that comes with ipratropium aerosol is designed for use only with a canister of ipratropium. Never use it to inhale any other medication, and do not use any other inhaler to inhale ipratropium.Do not use your ipratropium inhaler when you are near a flame or source of heat. The inhaler may explode if it is exposed to very high temperatures.Before you use ipratropium inhalation for the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use the inhaler or nebulizer. Practice using the inhaler or nebulizer while he or she watches.To use the inhaler, follow these steps:\n\nHold the inhaler with the clear end pointing upward. Place the metal canister inside the clear end of the inhaler. Be sure that it is fully and firmly in place and that the canister is at room temperature.Remove the protective dust cap from the end of the mouthpiece. If the dust cap was not placed on the mouthpiece, check the mouthpiece for dirt or other objectsIf you are using the inhaler for the first time or if you have not used the inhaler in 3 days, prime it by pressing down on the canister to release two sprays into the air, away from your face. Be careful not to spray medication into your eyes while you are priming the inhaler.Breathe out as completely as possible through your mouth.Hold the inhaler between your thumb and your next two fingers with the mouthpiece on the bottom, facing you. Place the open end of the mouthpiece into your mouth. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece. Close your eyes.Breathe in slowly and deeply through the mouthpiece. At the same time, press down firmly on the canister.Hold your breath for 10 seconds. Then remove the inhaler, and breathe out slowly.If you were told to use two puffs, wait at least 15 seconds and then repeat steps 4 to 7.Replace the protective cap on the inhaler.To inhale the solution using a nebulizer, follow these steps;\n\nTwist off the top of one vial of ipratropium solution and squeeze all of the liquid into the nebulizer reservoir.Connect the nebulizer reservoir to the mouthpiece or face mask.Connect the nebulizer to the compressor.Place the mouthpiece in your mouth or put on the face mask. Sit in an upright, comfortable position and turn on the compressor.Breathe in calmly, deeply, and evenly for about 5 to 15 minutes until mist stops forming in the nebulizer chamber.Clean your inhaler or nebulizer regularly. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your inhaler or nebulizer.",

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use beclomethasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.Talk to your doctor about how you should use your other oral and inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with beclomethasone inhalation. If you were taking an oral steroid such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Rayos), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose starting after you begin to use beclomethasone.Beclomethasone controls symptoms of asthma but does not cure it. Improvement in your asthma may occur as soon as 24 hours after using the medication, but full effects may not be seen for 1 to 4 weeks after using it regularly. Continue to use beclomethasone even if you feel well. Do not stop using beclomethasone without talking to your doctor. Call your doctor if your symptoms or your child's symptoms do not improve during the first 4 weeks or if they get worse.Beclomethasone helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks. Tell your doctor if your asthma worsens during your treatment.Do not use your beclomethasone inhaler when you are near a flame or source of heat. The inhaler may explode if it is exposed to very high temperatures.Each beclomethasone inhaler is designed to provide 50, 100, or 120 inhalations, depending on its size. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. You should keep track of the number of inhalations you have used. You can divide the number of inhalations in your inhaler by the number of inhalations you use each day to find out how many days your inhaler will last. Throw away the inhaler after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed.Before you use beclomethasone inhaler the first time, read the written instructions that come with the inhaler. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you the right way to use the inhaler. Practice using the inhaler in front of him or her, so you are sure you are doing it the right way.To use the aerosol inhaler, follow these steps:\n\nKeep the inhaler clean and dry with the cover tightly in place at all times. To clean your inhaler, use a clean, dry tissue or cloth. Do not wash or put any part of your inhaler in water.Remove the protective cap.If you are using the inhaler for the first time or if you have not used the inhaler in more than 10 days, prime it by releasing 2 test sprays into the air, away from your face. Be careful not to spray the medication into your eyes or face.Breathe out as completely as possible through your mouth.Hold the inhaler in the upright (mouthpiece up) or horizontal position. Place the mouthpiece between your lips well into your mouth. Tilt your head slightly back. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece keeping your tongue below it. Inhale slowly and deeply. Breathe in slowly and deeply through the mouthpiece. At the same time, press down once on the container to spray the medication into your mouth.When you have breathed in fully, remove the inhaler from your mouth and close your mouth.Try to hold your breath for about 5 to 10 seconds, then breathe out gently.If your doctor has told you to take more than 1 puff per treatment, repeat steps 3 through 7.Replace the protective cap on the inhaler.After each treatment, rinse your mouth with water and spit. Do not swallow the water.",

You can drink this mixture immediately or to make taking it easier, add at least 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of additional water, milk product, apple juice, orange juice, cranberry juice, or a carbonated beverage, or alternatively, a soft food may be added. Then, swallow the entire mixture immediately. After taking the dose, rinse the cup with a small amount of additional liquid or soft food and take it immediately to be sure that you receive the entire dose. If you need more than five 20 mg-tablets of bedaquiline, repeat the steps above until you reach your prescribed dose.Alternatively, to make it easier to swallow, you can also crush the 20 mg tablets and add to a soft food such as yogurt, applesauce, mashed banana, or oatmeal and swallow the entire mixture immediately. After taking the dose, add a small amount of additional soft food and take it immediately to be sure that you receive the entire dose.If you have a nasogastric (NG) tube, your doctor or pharmacist will explain how to prepare bedaquiline to give through an NG tube.Continue to take bedaquiline until you finish the prescription and do not miss doses, even if you feel better. If you stop taking bedaquiline too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics. This will make your infection harder to treat in the future. To make it easier for you to take all of your medication as directed, you may participate in a directly observed therapy program. In this program, a healthcare worker will give you each dose of medication and will watch as you swallow the medication.",

If you are just starting to use the Xulane brand estrogen and progestin contraceptive patch, you may apply your first patch on the first day of your menstrual period or on the first Sunday after your period begins. If you apply your first patch after the first day of your menstrual period, you must use a backup method of birth control (such as a condom and/or a spermicide) for the first 7 days of the first cycle. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist to find out when in your cycle you should start using your contraceptive patch.When changing your patch, always apply your new patch on the same day of the week (the Patch Change Day). Apply a new patch once a week for 3 weeks. During Week 4, remove the old patch but do not apply a new patch, and expect to begin your menstrual period. On the day after Week 4 ends, apply a new patch to start a new 4-week cycle even if your menstrual period has not started or has not ended. You should not go more than 7 days without a patch.Apply the contraceptive patch to a clean, dry, intact, healthy area of skin on the buttock, abdomen, upper outer arm, or upper torso, in a place where it will not be rubbed by tight clothing. Do not place the contraceptive patch on the breasts or on skin that is red, irritated, or cut. Do not apply makeup, creams, lotions, powders, or other topical products to the skin area where the contraceptive patch is placed. Each new patch should be applied to a new spot on the skin to help avoid irritation.Do not cut, decorate, or change the patch in any way. Do not use extra tape, glue, or wraps to hold the patch in place.Each brand of estrogen and progestin contraceptive patches should be applied following the specific directions given in the manufacturer's information for the patient. Read this information carefully before you start using estrogen and progestin contraceptive patches and each time you refill your prescription. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. The following general directions can help you remember some important things to do when you apply any type of estrogen and progestin contraceptive patch:\n\nTear open the pouch with your fingers. Do not open the pouch until you are ready to apply the patch.Remove the patch from the pouch. Be careful not to remove the clear plastic liner as you remove the patch.Peel away half or the larger part of the plastic liner. Avoid touching the sticky surface of the patch.Apply the sticky surface of the patch to the skin and remove the other part of the plastic liner. Press down firmly on the patch with the palm of your hand for 10 seconds, making sure that the edges stick well.After one week, remove the patch from your skin. Fold the used patch in half so that it sticks to itself and dispose of it so that it is out of the reach of children and pets. Do not flush the used patch down the toilet.Check your patch every day to make sure it is sticking. If the patch has been partially or completely detached for less than one day, try to reapply it in the same place immediately. Do not try to reapply a patch that is no longer sticky, that has stuck to itself or another surface, that has any material stuck to its surface or that has loosened or fallen off before. Apply a new patch instead. Your Patch Change Day will stay the same. If the patch has been partially or completely detached for more than one day, or if you do not know how long the patch has been detached, you may not be protected from pregnancy. You must start a new cycle by applying a new patch immediately; the day that you apply the new patch becomes your new Patch Change Day.

Budesonide nasal spray is usually sprayed in each nostril once daily. If you are an adult, you will begin your treatment with a higher dose of budesonide nasal spray and then decrease your dose when your symptoms improve. If you are giving budesonide nasal spray to a child, you will begin treatment with a lower dose of the medication and increase the dose if the child's symptoms do not improve. Decrease the dose when the child's symptoms improve. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use budesonide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.An adult should help children younger than 12 years old to use budesonide nasal spray. Children younger than 6 years of age should not use this medication.Budesonide nasal spray is only for use in the nose. Do not swallow the nasal spray and be careful not to spray it into your eyes or mouth.Each bottle of budesonide nasal spray should only be used by one person. Do not share budesonide nasal spray because this may spread germs.Budesonide nasal spray controls the symptoms of hay fever or allergies but does not cure these conditions. Your symptoms may begin to improve 1 to 2 days after you first use budesonide, but it may take up to 2 weeks before you feel the full benefit of budesonide. Budesonide works best when used regularly. Use budesonide on a regular schedule unless your doctor has told you to use it as needed. Call your doctor if your symptoms get worse or do not improve after you use budesonide nasal spray daily for 2 weeks.Budesonide nasal spray is designed to provide a certain number of sprays. After the marked number of sprays has been used, the remaining sprays in the bottle might not contain the correct amount of medication. You should keep track of the number of sprays you have used and throw away the bottle after you have used the marked number of sprays even if it still contains some liquid.Before you use budesonide nasal spray for the first time, read the written directions that come with it. Follow these steps:\n\nShake the bottle gently before each use.Remove the dust cover.If you are using the pump for the first time or have not used it for 2 or more days in a row, you must prime it by following steps 4 to 5 below. If you have used the pump before and have not missed 2 days in a row of medication, skip to step 6.Hold the pump with the applicator between your forefinger and middle finger and the bottom of the bottle resting on your thumb. Point the applicator away from your face.If you are using the pump for the first time, press down and release the pump eight times. If you have used the pump before, but not within the past 2 days, press down and release the pump once until you see a fine spray. If you have not used the pump for more than 14 days, rinse the applicator tip and prime with two or more sprays until you see a fine spray.Blow your nose until your nostrils are clear.Hold one nostril closed with your finger.Tilt your head slightly forward and carefully put the nasal applicator tip into your other nostril. Be sure to keep the bottle upright.Hold the pump with the applicator between your forefinger and middle finger and the bottom resting on your thumb.Begin to breathe in through your nose.While you are breathing in, use your forefinger and middle finger to press firmly down on the applicator and release a spray.Lean your head back and breathe gently in through the nostril and breathe out through your mouth.If your doctor told you to use additional sprays in that nostril, repeat steps 6 to 12.Repeat steps 6 to 13 in the other nostril.Do not blow your nose for 15 minutes after you use the nasal spray.Wipe the applicator with a clean tissue and cover it with the dust cover.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.",

        "Text1": "How should this medicine be used?\n\nBudesonide comes as a powder to inhale by mouth using an inhaler and as a suspension to inhale by mouth using a special jet nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled). Budesonide powder for oral inhalation is usually inhaled twice a day. Budesonide suspension for oral inhalation is usually inhaled once or twice a day. Try to use budesonide at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use budesonide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nTalk to your doctor about how you should use your other oral and inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with budesonide inhalation. If you were taking an oral steroid such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Rayos), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose starting after you begin to use budesonide.\n\nBudesonide controls symptoms of asthma but does not cure it. Improvement in your asthma may occur as soon after using the medication, but full effects of may not be seen for 1 to 2 weeks after using the powder and 4 to 6 weeks after using the suspension on a regular basis. Continue to use budesonide even if you feel well. Do not stop using budesonide without talking to your doctor. Call your doctor if your symptoms or your child's symptoms do not improve during the first 2 weeks (powder) or first 6 weeks (suspension) or if they get worse.\n\nBudesonide helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks. Tell your doctor if your asthma worsens during your treatment.\n\nEach budesonide inhaler is designed to provide 60 or 120 inhalations, depending on its size. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. You should keep track of the number of inhalations you have used. You can divide the number of inhalations in your inhaler by the number of inhalations you use each day to find out how many days your inhaler will last. Dispose of the inhaler after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed.\n\nDo not swallow budesonide nebulizer suspension.\n\nBefore you use budesonide inhaler or jet nebulizer the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler or nebulizer. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you the right way to use the inhaler or nebulizer. Practice using the inhaler or nebulizer in front of him or her, so you are sure you are doing it the right way.\n\nTo inhale the powder using the inhaler, follow these steps:\nTurn the protective cover and lift it off.\nThe first time you use a new budesonide inhaler you must prime it. To do this, hold the inhaler upright (with mouthpiece up), then twist the brown grip fully to the right as far as it will go, then back again fully to the left. You will hear a click. Repeat. The unit is now primed and ready to load the first dose. You do not have to prime the inhaler again after this, even if you do not use it for a long time.\nHolding the inhaler upright, load the first dose by turning the grip fully to the right and fully to the left until it clicks.\nTurn your head away from the inhaler and breathe out. Do not blow or exhale into the inhaler. Do not shake the inhaler after loading it.\nHold the inhaler in the upright (mouthpiece up) or horizontal position. Place the mouthpiece between your lips well into your mouth. Tilt your head slightly back. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece, but do not bite or chew the mouthpiece. Inhale deeply and forcefully. Be sure that the mist goes into your throat and is not blocked by your teeth or tongue.\nRemove the inhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for about 10 seconds. Do not blow or exhale through the inhaler.\nIf you are to inhale two puffs, repeat steps 4-6. For the next puff the inhaler must be loaded in the upright position right before its use. Turn the grip fully to the right and then fully to the left until it clicks.\nReplace the protective cap on the inhaler and twist it shut.\nAfter each treatment, rinse your mouth with water and spit. Do not swallow the water.\nKeep the inhaler clean and dry with the cover tightly in place at all times.\nTo inhale the suspension using the jet nebulizer, follow these steps:\nRemove one ampule of inhalation suspension from the foil pouch.\nGently shake the ampule in a circular motion.\nHold the ampule upright and twist off the top of the ampule. Pour all of the liquid into the nebulizer reservoir. Do not mix other medications with budesonide in the reservoir.\nConnect the nebulizer reservoir to the mouthpiece or face mask.\nConnect the nebulizer to the compressor.\nPlace the mouthpiece in your child's mouth or use the face mask. Have your child sit in an upright, comfortable position and turn on the compressor.\nTell your child to breathe in calmly, deeply, and evenly until mist stops forming in the chamber.\nAfter each treatment, have your child rinse their mouth with water and spit; do not swallow the water.\nDispose of the empty ampule and its top in a trash can that is out of the reach of children and pets.\nClean your nebulizer regularly. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your nebulizer.",

It is usually taken twice each night because calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate wears off after a short time, and the effects of one dose will not last for the entire night. The first dose is taken at bedtime, and the second dose is taken 2 1/2 to 4 hours after the first dose. Calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate must be taken on an empty stomach, so the first dose should be taken at least 2 hours after eating. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.Do not take your bedtime doses of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate until you or your child are in bed and are ready to go to sleep for the night. Calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate begins to work very quickly, within 5 to 15 minutes after taking it. Place your second dose of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate in a safe place near your bed (or in an safe place to give to your child) before sleep. Use an alarm clock to be sure that you will wake up in time to take the second dose. If you or your child wake up before the alarm goes off and it has been at least 2 1/2 hours since you took your first dose, take your second dose, turn off the alarm, and go back to sleep.Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every week.Calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate may be habit forming. Do not take more of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you take too much calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate, you may experience life-threatening symptoms including seizures, slowed or stopped breathing, loss of consciousness, and coma. You may also develop a craving for calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate, feel a need to take larger and larger doses, or want to continue taking calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate even though it causes unpleasant symptoms. If you have taken calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate in amounts larger than prescribed by your doctor, and you suddenly stop taking it, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, restlessness, anxiety, abnormal thinking, loss of contact with reality, sleepiness, upset stomach, shaking of a part of your body that you cannot control, sweating, muscle cramps, and fast heartbeat.Calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate may help to control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to take calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate even if you feel well. Do not stop taking calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably want to decrease your dose gradually.

Use your other hand to place the tip of the measuring device in the center opening on the top of the bottle. Press the tip firmly into the opening.Hold the bottle and measuring device with one hand. Use your other hand to pull back on the plunger until it is even with the marking that matches the dose your doctor prescribed. Be sure to keep the bottle upright to allow the medication to flow into the measuring device.Remove the measuring device from the top of the bottle. Place the tip of the measuring device in one of the dosing cups provided with the medication.Press down on the plunger to empty the medication into the dosing cup.Add 2 ounces (60 milliliters, 1/4 cup, or about 4 tablespoons) of tap water to the dosing cup. Do not mix the medication with fruit juice, soft drinks, or any other liquid.Repeat steps 5 through 9 to prepare a dose of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate in the second dosing cup.Place the caps on both dosing cups. Turn each cap clockwise (to the right) until it clicks and locks in place.Rinse the measuring device with water.Replace the cap on the bottle of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate and return the bottle and measuring device to a safe place where they are stored away from children and pets. Place both prepared dosing cups of medication in a safe place near your bed or in safe place to give your child that is out of the reach of children and pets.When it is time for you to take the first dose of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate, press down on the cap and turn it counterclockwise (to the left). Drink all of the liquid while you are sitting on your bed.

The medication may also be taken as two doses on the day before the colonoscopy, with the first dose taken the late afternoon or early evening before the colonoscopy and the second dose taken 6 hours later. Your doctor will tell you exactly when you should take your medication. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid combination exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.To prepare for your colonoscopy, you may not eat any solid food or drink milk beginning the day before the procedure. You should only have clear liquids during this time. Examples of clear liquids are water, light colored fruit juice without pulp, clear broth, coffee or tea without milk, flavored gelatin, popsicles and soft drinks. Do not drink alcoholic beverages or any liquid that is red or purple. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about which liquids you may drink before your colonoscopy.If you are taking the powder (Prepopik®), you will need to mix the medication powder with cold water right before you take it. If you swallow the powder without mixing it with water, there is a greater chance that you will experience unpleasant or dangerous side effects. To prepare each dose of your medication, fill the dosing cup that was provided with the medication with cold water up to the lower line (5 ounces, 150 mL) that is marked on the cup. Pour in the contents of one packet of sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid powder and stir for 2 to 3 minutes to dissolve the powder. The mixture may become slightly warm as the powder dissolves. Drink the entire mixture right away. Mix the medication with water only when you are ready to take it; do not prepare the mixture in advance.If you are taking the solution (Clenpiq®), drink the entire contents of one bottle of sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid solution directly from the bottle for each dose you are to take. Sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid solution comes ready to drink and should not be mixed with a liquid before use.If you are taking the medication the night before and the morning of your colonoscopy, you will take your first dose between 5:00 to 9:00 p.m. on the night before your colonoscopy. After you take this dose, you will need to drink five 8-ounce (240 mL) drinks of clear liquid within the next 5 hours before you go to bed. You will take your second dose the next morning, about 5 hours before your colonoscopy is scheduled. After you take the second dose, you will need to drink three 8-ounce drinks of clear liquid within the next 5 hours, but you should finish all the drinks at least 2 hours before your colonoscopy.If you are taking both doses of the medication the day before your colonoscopy, you will take your first dose between 4:00-6:00 p.m. on the evening before your colonoscopy. After you take this dose, you will need to drink five 8-ounce drinks of clear liquid within 5 hours. You will take your next dose 6 hours later, between 10:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. After you take the second dose, you will need to drink three 8-ounce drinks of clear liquid within 5 hours.It is very important that you drink the required amounts of clear liquid during your treatment to replace the fluid that you will lose as your colon is emptied. You can use the dosing cup provided with your medication to measure your 8-ounce portions of liquid by filling the cup to the top line. You may find it easier to drink the full amount of liquid if you choose a variety of different clear liquid drinks.You will have many bowel movements during your treatment with sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid combination. Be sure to stay close to a toilet from the time you take your first dose of the medication until the time of your colonoscopy appointment. Ask your doctor about other things you can do to stay comfortable during this time.If you experience severe bloating or stomach pain after you take the first dose of this medication, wait until these symptoms go away before you take the second dose.Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid.

Instead, use dry hands to peel back the foil. Immediately take out the tablet and place it on your tongue. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with saliva. No water is needed to swallow disintegrating tablets.To measure clozapine oral suspension, follow these steps:Make sure the cap is tight on the oral suspension container by turning the cap clockwise (to the right). Shake the bottle up and down for 10 seconds before use.Remove the bottle cap by pushing down on the cap, then turn it counterclockwise (to the left). The first time you open a new bottle, push the adaptor into the bottle until the top of the adaptor is lined up with the top of the bottle.If your dose is 1 mL or less, use the smaller (1 mL) oral syringe. If your dose is more than 1 mL, use the larger (9 mL) oral syringe.Fill the oral syringe with by air by drawing back the plunger. Then insert the open tip of the oral syringe into the adaptor. Push all the air from the oral syringe into the bottle by pushing down on the plunger.While holding the oral syringe in place, carefully turn the bottle upside down.

Be careful not to pull the plunger all the way out.You will see a small amount of air near the end of the plunger in the oral syringe. Push on the plunger so the medication goes back into the bottle and the air disappears. Pull back on the plunger to draw your correct medication dose into the oral syringe.While still holding the oral syringe in the bottle, carefully turn the bottle upwards so the syringe is on top. Remove the oral syringe from the bottle neck adaptor without pushing on the plunger. Take the medication right after you draw it into the oral syringe.

It is usually injected as needed at the first sign of severe hypoglycemia. After the injection, the patient should be turned onto their side to prevent choking if they vomit. Use dasiglucagon injection exactly as directed; do not inject it more often or inject more or less of it than prescribed by your doctor.Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you, family, or caregivers who could be injecting the medication how to use and prepare dasiglucagon injection. Before a friend or family member uses dasiglucagon injection for the first time, read the patient information that comes with it. This information includes directions for how to use the injection device. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you or your caregivers have any questions about how to inject this medication.Following a dasiglucagon injection, an unconscious person with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) will usually wake within 15 minutes. Once the dasiglucagon has been given, immediately contact a doctor and get emergency medical treatment. If the person does not awaken within 15 minutes after an injection, give one more dose of dasiglucagon. Feed the individual a fast-acting source of sugar (e.g., regular soft drink or fruit juice) and then a long-acting source of sugar (e.g., crackers, cheese or a meat sandwich) as soon as they awaken and are able to swallow.Always look at the dasiglucagon solution before it is injected. It should be clear, colorless, and free of particles. Do not use dasiglucagon injection if it is cloudy, contains particles, or if the expiration date has passed. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.Dasiglucagon can be injected with the prefilled syringe or autoinjector in the upper arm, thigh, stomach, or buttocks. Roll back any clothing to expose bare skin; do not inject through clothes. Never inject the dasiglucagon prefilled syringe or autoinjector into a vein or muscle.It is important that all patients have a household member who knows the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to administer dasiglucagon. If you have low blood sugar often, keep dasiglucagon injection with you at all times. You should and a family member or friend should be able to recognize some of the signs and symptoms of low blood sugar (i.e., shakiness, dizziness or lightheadedness, sweating, confusion, nervousness or irritability, sudden changes in behavior or mood, headache, numbness or tingling around the mouth, weakness, pale skin, sudden hunger, clumsy or jerky movements). Try to eat or drink a food or beverage with sugar in it, such as hard candy or fruit juice, before it is necessary to administer dasiglucagon.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.",

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use methylphenidate patches exactly as directed.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of methylphenidate and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every week.\n\nYour doctor may tell you to stop using methylphenidate patches from time to time to see if the medication is still needed. Follow these directions carefully.\n\nApply the patch to the hip area. Do not apply the patch to an open wound or cut, to skin that is oily, irritated, red, or swollen, or to skin that is affected by a rash or other skin problem. Do not apply to the patch to the waistline because it may be rubbed off by tight clothing. Do not apply a patch to the same spot 2 days in a row; each morning apply the patch to the hip that did not have a patch the day before.\n\nMethylphenidate patches are designed to remain attached during normal daily activities, including swimming, showering, and bathing as long as they are applied properly. However, the patches may loosen or fall off during the day, especially if they get wet. If a patch does fall off, ask your child how and when this happened and where to find the patch. Do not use a dressing or tape to reapply a patch that has loosened or fallen off. Instead, dispose of the patch properly. Then apply a new patch to a different spot and remove the new patch at the time that you were scheduled to remove the original patch.\n\nWhile you are wearing the patch, do not use direct sources of heat such as hair dryers, heating pads, electric blankets, and heated waterbeds.\n\nBe careful not to touch the sticky side of a methylphenidate patch with your fingers when you are applying, removing, or throwing away the patch. If you accidentally touch the sticky side of the patch, finish applying or removing the patch and then wash your hands well with soap and water.\n\nTo apply the patch, follow these steps:\nWash and dry the skin in the area where you plan to apply the patch. Be sure that the skin is free of powders, oils, and lotions.\nOpen the tray that contains the patches and throw away the drying agent that comes in the tray.\nRemove one pouch from the tray and cut it open with scissors. Be careful not to cut the patch. Never use a patch that has been cut or damaged in any way.\nRemove the patch from the pouch and hold it with the protective liner facing you.\nPeel off half of the liner. The liner should peel off easily. If the liner is hard to remove, throw away the patch properly and use a different patch.\nUse the other half of the liner as a handle and apply the patch to the skin.\nPress the patch firmly in place and smooth it down.\nHold the sticky half of the patch down with one hand. Use the other hand to pull back the other half of the patch and gently peel off the remaining piece of the protective liner.\nUse the palm of your hand to press the entire patch firmly in place for about 30 seconds.\nGo around the edges of the patch with your fingers to press the edges onto the skin. Be sure that the entire patch is firmly attached to the skin.\nThrow away the empty pouch and the protective liner in a closed trash can that is out of reach of children and pets. Do not flush the pouch or liner down the toilet.\nWash your hands after you handle the patch.\nRecord the time that you applied the patch on the administration chart that comes with the patches. Use the timetable in the patient information that comes with the patches to find the time that the patch should be removed. Do not follow these times if your doctor has told you to use the patch for less than 9 hours. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully and ask your doctor if you do not know when you should remove the patch.\nWhen it is time to remove the patch, use your fingers to peel it off slowly. If the patch is stuck tightly to your skin, apply an oil-based product such as olive oil, mineral oil, or petroleum jelly to the edges of the patch and gently spread the oil under the patch. If the patch is still hard to remove, call your doctor or pharmacist. Do not use adhesive remover or nail polish remover to loosen the patch.\nFold the patch in half with the sticky sides together and press firmly to seal it shut. Flush the patch down the toilet or throw it away in a closed trash can that is out of the reach of children and pets.\nIf there is any adhesive left on the skin, gently rub the area with oil or lotion to remove it.\nWash your hands.\nRecord the time that you removed the patch and the way that you threw it away on the administration chart.\n\nAsk your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.",

The combination of levodopa and carbidopa also comes as a suspension (liquid) to be given into your stomach through a PEG-J tube (a tube surgically inserted through the skin and stomach wall) or sometimes through a naso-jejunal tube (NJ; a tube inserted into your nose and down to your stomach) using a special infusion pump. The regular and orally disintegrating tablets are usually taken three or four times a day. The extended-release tablet is usually taken two to four times a day. The extended-release capsule is usually taken three to five times a day. The suspension is usually given as a morning dose (given by infusion over 10 to 30 minutes) and then as a continuous dose (given by infusion over 16 hours), with extra doses given no more than once every 2 hours as needed to control your symptoms. Take levodopa and carbidopa at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take levodopa and carbidopa exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.Swallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not chew or crush them.Swallow the extended-release capsules whole; do not chew, divide, or crush them. Take the first daily dose of the extended-release capsule 1 to 2 hours before eating. If you have trouble swallowing, you can carefully open the extended-release capsule, sprinkle the entire contents on 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of apple sauce, and consume the mixture immediately. Do not store the mixture for future use.To take the orally disintegrating tablet, remove the tablet from the bottle using dry hands and immediately place it in your mouth. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with saliva. No water is needed to swallow disintegrating tablets.If you are switching from levodopa (Dopar or Larodopa; no longer available in the US) to the combination of levodopa and carbidopa, follow your doctor's instructions. You will probably be told to wait at least 12 hours after your last dose of levodopa to take your first dose of levodopa and carbidopa.Your doctor may start you on a low dose of levodopa and carbidopa and gradually increase your dose of the regular or orally disintegrating tablet every day or every other day as needed. Your doctor may gradually increase your dose of the extended-release tablet or capsule after 3 days as needed.To take the suspension, your doctor or pharmacist will show you how to use the pump to give your medication. Read the written instructions that come with the pump and the medication. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the pump and description of the keys. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.Levodopa and carbidopa suspension comes in a single-use cassette to connect to the pump that will control the amount of medication you will receive during your infusion. Before use, remove the cassette containing the medication from the refrigerator and allow it to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes. Do not reuse a cassette or use it for longer than 16 hours. Dispose of the cassette at the end of the infusion even if it still contains medication.When you begin taking levodopa and carbidopa suspension, your doctor will adjust your morning and continuous infusion doses and possibly the doses of your other Parkinson's disease medications to best control your symptoms. It usually takes about 5 days to reach a stable dose of the suspension, but your doses may need to be changed again over time depending on your ongoing response to the medication. Your prescribed dose of the suspension will be programmed into your pump by your doctor. Do not change the dose or settings on your pump unless you are told to do so by your doctor. Be careful to make sure your PEG-J tube does not become kinked, knotted, or blocked as this will affect the amount of medication that you receive.Levodopa and carbidopa controls Parkinson's disease but does not cure it. It may take several months before you feel the full benefit of levodopa and carbidopa. Continue to take levodopa and carbidopa even if you feel well. Do not stop taking levodopa and carbidopa without talking to your doctor.

Your doctor will train the person who will be injecting the medication, and will test him to be sure he can give the injection correctly. Be sure that you and the person who will be giving the injections read the manufacturer's information for the patient that comes with enfuvirtide before you use it for the first time at home.You can inject enfuvirtide anywhere on the front of your thighs, your stomach, or upper arms. Do not inject enfuvirtide in or near your navel (belly button) or in any area directly under a belt or waistband; near the elbow, knee, groin, the lower or inner buttocks; or directly over a blood vessel. To reduce the chances of soreness, choose a different area for each injection.

Never inject enfuvirtide into any skin that has a tattoo, scar, bruise, mole, a burn site, or has had a reaction to a previous injection of enfuvirtide.Never reuse needles, syringes, vials of enfuvirtide, or vials of sterile water. Dispose of used needles and syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Do not put them in a trash can. You can dispose of used alcohol pads and vials in the trash, but if you see blood on an alcohol pad, put it in the puncture-resistant container. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.Before preparing an enfuvirtide dose, wash your hands with soap and water. After you wash your hands, do not touch anything except the medication, supplies, and the area where you will inject the medication.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's injection information for the patient. Carefully read the manufacturer's instructions to learn how to prepare and inject your dose. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about how to inject enfuvirtide.",

Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed by your doctor.Lindane should only be used on the skin and hair. Never apply lindane to your mouth and never swallow it. Avoid getting lindane into your eyes.If lindane gets into your eyes, wash them with water right away and get medical help if they are still irritated after washing.When you apply lindane to yourself or someone else, wear gloves made of nitrile, sheer vinyl, or latex with neoprene. Do not wear gloves made of natural latex because they will not prevent lindane from reaching your skin. Dispose of your gloves and wash your hands well when you are finished.Lindane lotion is used only to treat scabies. Do not use it to treat lice. To use the lotion, follow these steps:\n\nYour fingernails should be trimmed short and your skin should be clean, dry, and free of other oils, lotions, or creams. If you need to bathe or shower, wait 1 hour before applying lindane to allow your skin to cool.Shake the lotion well.Put some lotion on a toothbrush. Use the toothbrush to apply the lotion under your fingernails. Wrap the toothbrush in paper and dispose of it. Do not use this toothbrush again to brush your teeth.Apply a thin layer of lotion all over your skin from your neck down to your toes (including the soles of your feet). You might not need all of the lotion in the bottle.Close the lindane bottle tightly and dispose of it safely, so that it is out of the reach of children. Do not save leftover lotion to use later.You may dress in loose fitting clothing, but do not wear tight or plastic clothing or cover your skin with blankets. Do not put plastic lined diapers on a baby who is being treated.Leave the lotion on your skin for 8-12 hours, but no longer. If you leave the lotion on longer, it will not kill any more scabies, but it may cause seizures or other serious side effects. Do not let anyone else touch your skin during this time. Other people may be harmed if their skin touches the lotion on your skin.After 8-12 hours have passed, wash off all of the lotion with warm water. Do not use hot water.Lindane shampoo is used only for pubic lice ('crabs') and head lice. Do not use the shampoo if you have scabies. To use the shampoo, follow these steps:\n\nWash your hair with your regular shampoo at least 1 hour before applying lindane and dry it thoroughly. Do not use any creams, oils, or conditioners.Shake the shampoo well. Apply just enough shampoo to make your hair, scalp, and the small hairs on the back of your neck wet. If you have pubic lice, apply the shampoo to the hair in your pubic area and the skin underneath. You might not need all of the shampoo in the bottle.Close the lindane bottle tightly and dispose of it safely, so that it is out of the reach of children. Do not save leftover shampoo to use later.Leave the lindane shampoo on your hair for exactly 4 minutes. Keep track of the time with a watch or clock. If you leave the lotion on for longer than 4 minutes, it will not kill any more lice, but it may cause seizures or other serious side effects. Keep your hair uncovered during this time.At the end of 4 minutes, use a small amount of warm water to lather the shampoo. Do not use hot water.Wash all of the shampoo off of your hair and skin with warm water.Dry your hair with a clean towel.Comb your hair with a fine tooth comb (nit comb) or use tweezers to remove nits (empty egg shells).

The cut will be closed with stitches or surgical strips and covered with a bandage. The implant may be inserted every 12 months. After 12 months, the current implant should be removed and can be replaced with another implant to continue treatment.

Do not swim or bathe during this time. Leave the bandage in place for at least 24 hours. If surgical strips are used, leave them on until they fall off on their own. Avoid heavy lifting and physical activity (including heavy play or exercise for children) with the treated arm for 7 days after receiving the implant. Avoid bumping the area around the implant for a few days after insertion.Histrelin may cause an increase in certain hormones in the first few weeks after insertion of the implant. Your doctor will monitor you carefully for any new or worsening symptoms during this time.Sometimes histrelin implant is hard to feel under the skin so the doctor may have to use certain tests, such as ultrasound or MRI scans (radiology techniques designed to show the images of body structures) to find the implant when it is time to remove it. Occasionally, histrelin implant may come out through the original insertion site on its own. You may or may not notice this happening.

The Liletta and Mirena brand intrauterine systems may be left in place for up to 6 years after they are inserted and the Skyla brand intrauterine system may be left in place for up to 3 years after it is inserted. If you still want to use an intrauterine system to prevent pregnancy after this time has passed, your healthcare provider can insert a new system as soon as the old system is removed. The intrauterine systems may be removed by a doctor any time that you want to become pregnant or want to use a different form of birth control. If the Mirena brand intrauterine system is used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding, it may be left in place for up to 5 years after it is inserted.Your doctor will tell you the best time to have the levonorgestrel intrauterine system inserted. Depending on the timing, you may need to use a non-hormonal birth control method such as condoms and spermicide for 7 days to prevent pregnancy if sexual intercourse occurs. Your intrauterine system may be inserted immediately after a first-trimester abortion. If you have given birth, had a miscarriage, or had a second-trimester abortion, your intrauterine system should not be inserted until at least 6 weeks have passed and a physical exam shows that your uterus has recovered from the pregnancy.You will need to have your intrauterine system inserted in your health-care provider's office or clinic. Your health-care provider may tell you to take a nonprescription pain reliever prior to your appointment to help decrease cramping during and after the placement. You may experience some of these symptoms during and after the placement: sweating, pale skin, fast heartbeat, fainting, dizziness, cramping, and bleeding. Tell your health-care provider if your cramping is severe or if these symptoms last for longer than 30 minutes. Your health-care provider will check you to be sure that your system has been placed correctly.Call your doctor if you experience severe pain during the first few hours after your intrauterine system is inserted. This may be a sign of a serious infection.Your health-care provider will place your intrauterine system into your uterus, but will leave two threads dangling through your cervix. You should check for these threads once a month so that you will know whether your intrauterine system is still in place. To check for the threads, you should wash your hands with soap and water. Then, reach up to the top of your vagina with clean fingers to feel the threads. If you cannot feel the threads or if you feel any part of the intrauterine system other than the threads, your intrauterine system may not be in place and may not prevent pregnancy. If this happens, call your doctor and use a non-hormonal birth control method such as condoms and spermicide to prevent pregnancy until you are seen by your doctor.You will need a follow-up appointment with your health-care provider 4-6 weeks after your intrauterine  system is inserted to be sure that your system is properly in place. After this appointment, you will need to be examined once every year or more often if you have any problems or concerns.If your levonorgestrel intrauterine system must be removed, talk to your doctor about the best time to remove it. You are not protected from pregnancy once your intrauterine system is removed, so if you do not want to become pregnant, you will need to be sure that you have effective birth control as soon as your intrauterine system is removed. If you plan to have your intrauterine system replaced with a new intrauterine system, you can have the old system removed and the new system inserted at any time during your menstrual cycle. If you have chosen to use a different form of birth control instead of your intrauterine system and you have regular menstrual cycles, you should have the system removed during the first 7 days after your menstrual period begins and begin using your new form of birth control right away. If you have chosen to use a different form of birth control and you do not have regular cycles, you do not menstruate at all, or you are not able to have your intrauterine system removed during the first 7 days of your menstrual period, you should start using your new form of birth control 7 days before your intrauterine system is removed.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.",

It is important to be on time and to not to miss your scheduled cell collection appointment(s) or to receive your treatment dose. You should plan to stay within 2 hours of the location where you received your tisagenlecleucel treatment for at least 4 weeks after your dose. Your healthcare provider will check to see if your treatment is working and monitor you for any possible side effects. Talk to your doctor about how to prepare for leukapheresis and what to expect during and after the procedure.",

The solution for oral inhalation is usually used three times a day, once every 6 to 8 hours. The inhaler is usually used every 4 to 6 hours. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use levalbuterol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nIf your asthma symptoms become worse, if levalbuterol inhalation becomes less effective, or if you need more doses than usual of the asthma medications you use as needed, your condition may be getting worse. Do not use extra doses of levalbuterol. Call your doctor right away.\n\nLevalbuterol controls symptoms of asthma and other lung diseases but does not cure these conditions. Continue to use levalbuterol even if you feel well. Do not stop using levalbuterol without talking to your doctor.\n\nIf you are using the inhaler, your medication will come in canisters. Each canister of levalbuterol aerosol is designed to provide 200 inhalations. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. Dispose of the canister after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed.\n\nYou will need to keep track of the number of inhalations you have used. You can divide the number of inhalations in your inhaler by the number of inhalations you use each day to find out how many days your inhaler will last. Do not float the canister in water to see if it still contains medication.\n\nThe inhaler that comes with levalbuterol aerosol is designed for use only with a canister of albuterol. Never use it to inhale any other medication, and do not use any other inhaler to inhale levalbuterol.\n\nBe careful not to get levalbuterol inhalation into your eyes.\n\nDo not use your levalbuterol inhaler when you are near a flame or source of heat. The inhaler may explode if it is exposed to very high temperatures.\n\nBefore you use levalbuterol for the first time, read the written instructions that come with the inhaler or nebulizer. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it. Practice using the inhaler or nebulizer while he or she watches.\n\nIf your child will be using the inhaler, be sure that he or she knows how to use it. Watch your child each time he or she uses the inhaler to be sure that he or she is using it correctly.\n\nTo use the aerosol inhaler, follow these steps:\nRemove the protective dust cap from the end of the mouthpiece. Check the mouthpiece for dirt or other objects. Be sure that the canister is fully and firmly inserted in the mouthpiece.\nShake the inhaler well.\nIf you are using the inhaler for the first time or if you have not used the inhaler in more than 3 days, you will need to prime it. To prime the inhaler, press down on the canister four times to release four sprays into the air, away from your face. Be careful not to get albuterol in your eyes.\nBreathe out as completely as possible through your mouth.\nHold the canister with the mouthpiece on the bottom, facing you, and the canister pointing upward. Place the open end of the mouthpiece into your mouth. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece.\nBreathe in slowly and deeply through the mouthpiece.At the same time, press down once on the container with your middle finger to spray the medication into your mouth.\nAs soon as the medication is released, remove your finger from the canister and remove the mouthpiece from your mouth.\nTry to hold your breath for 10 seconds.\nIf you were told to use two puffs, wait 1 minute and then repeat steps 4 to 8.\nReplace the protective cap on the inhaler.\nTo use the solution or the concentrated solution for oral inhalation, follow these steps:\nOpen the foil pouch by tearing through the rough edge along the side of the pouch and remove one vial. Leave the rest of the vials inside the foil pouch to protect them from light. Look at the solution in the vial to be sure it is colorless. If it is not colorless, call your doctor or pharmacist and do not use the solution.\nTwist off the top of the vial and squeeze all of the liquid into the reservoir of your nebulizer. Do not add any other medications to the nebulizer because it may not be safe to mix them with levalbuterol. Use all nebulized medications separately unless your doctor specifically tells you to mix them.\nIf you are using the concentrated solution, add the amount of normal saline that your doctor told you to use to the reservoir. Gently swirl the nebulizer to mix the normal saline and the concentrated solution.\nConnect the nebulizer reservoir to your mouthpiece or facemask.\nConnect the nebulizer to the compressor.\nSit upright and place the mouthpiece in your mouth or put on the facemask.\nTurn on the compressor.\nBreathe calmly, deeply, and evenly until mist stops forming in the nebulizer. This should take between 5 and 15 minutes.\nClean the nebulizer according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nClean your inhaler or nebulizer regularly. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your inhaler or nebulizer. If you do not clean your inhaler properly, the inhaler may become blocked and may not spray medication. If this happens, follow the manufacturer's directions for cleaning the inhaler and removing the blockage.",

Then pull apart the zipper seal.Remove up to three patches from the package and press the zipper seal tightly together. The remaining patches may dry out if the zipper seal is not tightly closed.Cut patch(es) to the size and shape that will cover your most painful area.Peel the transparent liner off the back of the patch(es).Press the patch(es) firmly onto your skin. If you are applying a patch to your face, be careful not to let it touch your eyes.

Do not apply the patch to your arms below the elbows, to your legs below the knees, or to skin folds. Apply the patch to clean, dry, hairless skin that is not irritated, scarred, burned, broken, or calloused. Choose a different area each day.You may shower while you are wearing a nitroglycerin skin patch.If a patch loosens or falls off, replace it with a fresh one.To use nitroglycerin patches, follow the steps below. Different brands of nitroglycerin patches may be applied in slightly different ways, so be sure to follow the directions included with your patches:\n\nWash your hands.Hold the patch so that the plastic backing is facing you.Bend the sides of the patch away from you and then toward you until you hear a snap.Peel off one side of the plastic backing.Use the other side of the patch as a handle, and apply the stick half to your skin in the spot you have chosen.Press the sticky side of the patch against the skin and smooth it down.Fold back the other side of the patch. Hold onto the remaining piece of plastic backing and use it to pull the patch across the skin.Wash your hands again.When you are ready to remove the patch, press down on its center to lift the edges away from the skin.Hold the edge gently and slowly peel the patch away from the skin.Fold the patch in half with the sticky side pressed together and dispose of it safely, out of the reach of children and pets. The used patch may still contain active medication that can harm others.Wash the skin that was covered with the patch with soap and water. The skin may be red and may feel warm for a short time. You may apply lotion if the skin is dry, and you should call your doctor if the redness does not go away after a short time.Nitroglycerin patches may no longer work as well after you have used them for some time. To prevent this, your doctor will probably tell you to wear each patch for only 12 to 14 hours each day so that there is a period of time when you are not exposed to nitroglycerin every day. If your angina attacks happen more often, last longer, or become more severe at any time during your treatment, call your doctor.Nitroglycerin patches help prevent attacks of angina but do not cure coronary artery disease. Continue to use nitroglycerin patches even if you feel well. Do not stop using nitroglycerin patches without talking to your doctor.",

If you have strong or frequent cravings, you may chew a second piece within one hour. To improve your chances of quitting smoking, chew at least 9 pieces of nicotine gum each day for the first 6 weeks.Chew nicotine gum slowly until you can taste the nicotine or feel a slight tingling in your mouth. Then stop chewing and place (park) the chewing gum between your cheek and gum. When the tingling is almost gone (about 1 minute), start chewing again; repeat this procedure for about 30 minutes. Avoid eating and drinking for 15 minutes before and during chewing of nicotine gum.Do not chew nicotine gum too fast, do not chew more than one piece of gum at a time, and do not chew one piece too soon after another. Chewing one piece of gum after another continuously may cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea, or other side effects.Do not chew more than 24 pieces a day.You should stop using nicotine gum after 12 weeks of use. If you still feel the need to use nicotine gum after 12 weeks, talk to your doctor.",

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part that you do not understand. Take oseltamivir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.It is important to know the dose of medication your doctor has prescribed and to use a measuring device that will measure the dose accurately. If you are taking the medication yourself or giving it to a child older than 1 year of age, you can use the device provided by the manufacturer to measure the dose according to the instructions below. If you are giving the medication to a child under one year of age, you should not use the measuring device provided by the manufacturer because it cannot accurately measure small doses. Instead, use the device provided by your pharmacist. If the commercial suspension is unavailable and your pharmacist prepares a suspension for you, he or she will provide a device to measure your dose. Never use a household teaspoon to measure doses of oseltamivir oral suspension.If you are giving the commercial suspension to an adult or child over one year of age, follow these steps to measure the dose using the syringe provided:\n\nShake the suspension well (for about 5 seconds) before each use to mix the medication evenly.Open the bottle by pushing down on the cap and turning the cap at the same time.Push the plunger of the measuring device completely down to the tip.Insert the tip of the measuring device firmly into the opening on the top of the bottle.Turn the bottle (with the measuring device attached) upside down.Pull back on the plunger slowly until the amount of suspension prescribed by your doctor fills the measuring device to the appropriate marking.

Allow the parts to air dry before putting back together for the next use.Call your doctor or pharmacist to find out how you should measure a dose of oseltamivir suspension if you do not have the measuring device that came with this medication.If you have difficulty swallowing capsules, your doctor may tell you to open the capsule and mix the contents with a sweetened liquid. To prepare doses of oseltamivir for people who cannot swallow the capsules:\n\nHold the capsule over a small bowl and carefully pull open the capsule and empty all of the powder from the capsule into the bowl. If your doctor has instructed you to take more than one capsule for your dose, then open the correct number of capsules into the bowl.Add a small amount of sweetened liquid, such as regular or sugar-free chocolate syrup, corn syrup, caramel topping, or light brown sugar dissolved in water to the powder.Stir the mixture.Swallow the entire contents of this mixture right away.Continue to take oseltamivir until you finish the prescription, even if you start to feel better. Do not stop taking oseltamivir without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking oseltamivir too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be fully treated, or you may not be protected from the flu.If you feel worse or develop new symptoms while taking oseltamivir, or if your flu symptoms do not start to get better, call your doctor.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.",

Then, carefully push the syringe plunger in slowly until the bubbles disappear, without pushing any of the solution out of the syringe.\nChoose an injection spot and clean the skin in the area with an alcohol pad. Wait for the area to dry.\nRemove the protective cap from the needle. Make sure the safety sleeve of the syringe is pushed firmly against the rim of the syringe so that the needle is fully exposed.\nPinch up a 2-inch (5-centimeter) fold of loose skin at the injection spot. With your other hand, pick up the syringe and hold it like a pencil with the point (bevel) of the needle facing up. Push the needle approximately 1/4 inch (0.6 centimeters) into the pinched skin at a 45- to 90-degree angle, using a quick, dart-like thrust.\nLet the pinched skin loose and use that hand to help hold the syringe barrel.\nPull the plunger of the syringe back very slightly. If blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. Do not inject. Pull the needle out at the same angle you put it into the skin, and dispose of the syringe in a puncture-proof container. Repeat the steps above to prepare a new dose using a new syringe and a new vial. If no blood comes into the syringe, inject the medication by gently pressing the plunger all the way down the syringe barrel.\nHold an alcohol pad near the needle and pull the needle straight out of the skin.

Your doctor will tell you how to use the kit and whether you should take all the tablets it contains.

Your doctor will probably want to increase your dose again gradually.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.",
