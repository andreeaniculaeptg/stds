Pancrelipase delayed-release capsules (Creon, Pancreaze, Zenpep) are also used to improve digestion of food in infants who do not have enough pancreatic enzymes (substances needed to break down food so it can be digested) because they have cystic fibrosis or another condition that affects the pancreas. Pancrelipase delayed-release capsules (Creon) are also used to improve digestion in people who have had surgery to remove all or part of the pancreas or stomach. Pancrelipase tablets (Viokace) are used along with another medication (proton pump inhibitor; PPI) to improve digestion of foods in adults who have chronic pancreatitis or who have had surgery to remove the pancreas. Pancrelipase is in a class of medications called enzymes.  Pancrelipase acts in place of the enzymes normally made by the pancreas.  It works to decrease fatty bowel movements and to improve nutrition by breaking down fats, proteins, and starches from food into smaller substances that can be absorbed from the intestine.",

The combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir is in a class of medications called antivirals. Elvitegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir work by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Cobicistat helps to keep elvitegravir in the body longer so that the medication will have a greater effect. Although the combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir will not cure HIV, these medications may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV virus to other people.",

Glyburide belongs to a class of drugs called sulfonylureas, and metformin is in a class of drugs called biguanides. Glyburide lowers blood sugar by causing the pancreas to produce insulin (a natural substance that is needed to break down sugar in the body) and helping the body use insulin efficiently. This medication will only help lower blood sugar in people whose bodies produce insulin naturally. Metformin helps your body control the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood. It decreases the amount of glucose you absorb from your food and the amount of glucose made by your liver. It also helps your body use its own insulin more effectively. Glyburide and metformin are not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may occur if high blood sugar is not treated).",

Prescription lansoprazole is also used to treat ulcers (sores in the lining of the stomach or intestine), to prevent more ulcers from developing in adults whose ulcers have already healed, and to decrease the risk that adults who are taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will develop ulcers. Prescription lansoprazole is also used to treat conditions where the stomach produces too much acid, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in adults. Prescription lansoprazole is also used in combination with other medications to treat and prevent stomach ulcers caused by a certain type of bacteria (H. pylori) in adults. Nonprescription (over-the-counter) lansoprazole is used to treat frequent heartburn (heartburn that occurs two or more days per week) in adults. Lansoprazole is in a class of medications called proton pump inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of acid made in the stomach.",
